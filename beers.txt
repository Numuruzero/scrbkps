Beer Varieties:

Electro-lite -- A "lite" (but not alcohol-free) energy-drink-like beer. Brewed by the proprietor of The Squeaky Wheel. Crafted to solve the issue of patrons overextending their credit line. Imbues the user with a great deal of energy and then forces them to expend it by running, conscious or not. The back wall of the tavern is lined with the crankwheels for which it's named, and poor souls pay their debt by generating energy on the wheel. Imbibers often wake up feeling exhausted, with a raging hangover and amazing quads.

Freebird -- A red ale which is actually blue, imbued with Thunderbird essence. Brewed by Musk Brewing. As usual, the Musk brothers refuse to elaborate on the definition of "essence", but this draft is tasty enough that the Ironborn don't seem to care. Not only is the taste refreshing, but the slight tingle actually seems to perk up every muscle in the drinker's body, which has started more than one competition to grab the highest rafter. Unfortunately, their control is not helped in the slightest by the alcohol, and has also started more than one competition for fastest bar rebuilding.

Wisebeer -- A wheat beer, with more wheat than beer. Brewed by Stela Shores. An unusual entry for a distillery most often focused on high-end liquors. This brew tastes like a home you've never had, with homesickness to match. Oddly, drinkers often report that this brew increases their inhibitions, somehow imbuing a sense of caution and rigidity that makes it hard to judge sincerity - but this goes both ways. Banned from poker games.
